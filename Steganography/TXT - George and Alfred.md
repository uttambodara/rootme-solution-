+ This challenge is only available in french language due to its specificity.
This issue requires access in French to view the content.

When I interpreted the problem, I couldn't find a clue to solving it, so I looked up George Sand & Alfred de Musset.

Since the information I looked up was in French and there wasn't much information, I couldn't exactly understand what the technique was.

From what I've looked into, it seems to be one of the classic cryptography techniques, a technique used to hide codes in letters exchanged between George and Alfred de Musset.
Actually, I don't really know what the red color means just by looking at this data.

I understood it by running it on the site https://www.apprendre-en-ligne.net/crypto/stegano/lettres.html .

There is also an explanation of the content at https://www.canalacademies.com/emissions/a-voix-lue/echange-epistolaire-entre-george-sand-et-alfred-de-musset , but I don't really understand what it means..!

If we interpret the message at the very end of the problem, it says, "Use the last "hidden phrase", to validate this test." It asks us to find the hidden phrase in the last paragraph, so we can see that the **correct answer is Cette Nuit**.
